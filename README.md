# CSV Importer

While created for Renderdoc .csv files, this is intended to be a general-purpose .csv mesh importer. It will assume vertex indicies as the row number, and crate faces based on that. All options on the import panel have descriptive tooltips.

To install, download ImportCSV.py and install as a blender addon. *Do not clone the repository as a .zip file*
